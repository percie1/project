#  Global COVID-19 Trends: A Data Analysis and Visualization Dashboard

## Project Description

This project analyzes the global trends of COVID-19 by exploring real-world data on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations. Using Python data tools, the project cleans the data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizes insights across countries and over time. The goal is to help users understand how the pandemic evolved and how different regions responded.

##  Objectives

- Load and clean real-world COVID-19 data
- Analyze global trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare statistics between countries and continents
- Visualize key trends using line plots, bar charts, and interactive visuals
- Generate insights on the global progression and impact of COVID-19

---

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – data processing and analysis
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** – static visualizations
- **Seaborn** – enhanced charting
- **Plotly Express** – interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for running and documenting the code

## How to Run or View the Project

1. **Install Python and dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly




 Insights and Reflections

    Global new case numbers peaked in multiple waves over time.

    Countries with higher vaccination rates experienced lower mortality in later waves.

    Deaths per 100k population were highest in countries with slower or overwhelmed responses.

    Continental trends revealed disparities in pandemic response and recovery.

    Real-world data often requires significant cleaning before analysis.
